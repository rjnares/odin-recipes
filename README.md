# Odin Recipes

Odin Recipes is a basic recipe website created as a project assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course, specifically, from the [HTML Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations) section.

## Project Description

This website displays several recipes along with recipe-specific information, such as the name, visual, description, ingredients, and steps to prepare.

## Skills Applied

The main goal of this project was to apply the HTML foundations that were taught in the course.

This consisted of the following:

* Creating an `index.html` homepage with links to recipe pages
* Creating several recipe pages that followed the same structure: name, visual, description, ingredients, and steps
* Using correct heading elements for different sections of a page (i.e. `<h1>` for the main heading vs `<h2>` for subheadings)
* Using `<img>` elements with relative source paths for the visual in the recipe pages
* Using `<p>` elements for the description section in the recipe pages
* Using `<ul>` elements for recipe page links in the `index.html` and ingredients sections in the recipe pages
* Using `<ol>` elements for steps section in the recipe pages
